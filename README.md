# Wi-Fi Scanner App

A simple Python application to scan the local network and retrieve the IP and MAC addresses of devices connected to the network.

## Features

- Scan a given IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
- Displays a list of connected devices' IP addresses and corresponding MAC addresses.
- Option to automatically retrieve your IP address and use it for scanning.
- Continuous scanning loop with start and stop functionality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` for network scanning.
- `customtkinter` for the GUI interface.

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
